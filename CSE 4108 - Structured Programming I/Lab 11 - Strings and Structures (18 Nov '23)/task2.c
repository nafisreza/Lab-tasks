2. UNO Reverse:
Write a program named reverse.c that echoes its command-line arguments in
reverse order. Running the program by typing â‡’ reverse void and null should
produce the following output:
null and void.
Hint: You have to run the code from the command line. Pass the arguments &quot;void
and null&quot; after the name of the .exe file in the command line.
